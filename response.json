                "message": "### Key Points\n- It seems likely that Google's Veo 3 is the most popular AI video model on X right now, based on recent discussions.\n- Research suggests Veo 3, released in May 2025, has generated significant buzz due to its advanced features.\n- Other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen are also popular, but current evidence leans toward Veo 3 for recent engagement on X.\n\n### Introduction\nThe question of the most popular AI video model on X (formerly Twitter) involves analyzing recent trends and discussions on the platform. Given the rapid advancements in AI, especially in video generation, several models are in the spotlight. Here's a breakdown of the findings, focusing on Google's Veo 3, which appears to be leading the conversation.\n\n### Analysis\nGoogle's Veo 3, released in May 2025, stands out due to its recent introduction and the high engagement seen in X posts. It features native audio generation, including dialogue and sound effects, which has been praised by creators and tech enthusiasts. For instance, an X post by Google on May 21, 2025, announcing Veo 3 received over 19 million views, indicating significant interest ([Google's announcement](https://x.com/Google/status/1924893837295546851)). Other posts, like one by @joshwoodward on May 25, 2025, noted its popularity with over 826,000 views, further supporting its current trendiness ([@joshwoodward's post](https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1926311143867330938)).\n\nWhile other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen have been popular, their recent activity on X is less pronounced. Runway Gen-3 saw significant discussion in mid-2024, but posts from that period show lower recent engagement compared to Veo 3's May 2025 activity. Similarly, HeyGen, while rated highly in 2025 lists, has X posts dating back to early 2025, suggesting its buzz has waned compared to Veo 3's current momentum.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the recency and high engagement of Veo 3-related posts on X, it seems likely that Google's Veo 3 is currently the hottest AI video model on the platform as of June 3, 2025. However, the AI video generation field is dynamic, and popularity can shift with new releases.\n\n---\n\n### Comprehensive Analysis of AI Video Model Popularity on X\n\nThis section provides a detailed examination of the factors leading to the conclusion that Google's Veo 3 is the most popular AI video model on X as of June 3, 2025. The analysis is based on recent discussions, engagement metrics, and comparisons with other notable models, ensuring a thorough understanding of the current landscape.\n\n#### Background and Methodology\nThe inquiry into the \"hostest AI Video model on X\" (interpreted as the \"hottest\" or most popular) required identifying AI models capable of generating videos, such as text-to-video or image-to-video systems, and assessing their prominence on X. The current date, June 3, 2025, was used to filter for recent trends, focusing on posts and discussions from May and early June 2025 to capture the latest activity.\n\nTo gather data, a multi-step approach was employed:\n1. **Web Search for Context**: A search for \"latest AI video generation models 2025\" in news mode was conducted to identify recent advancements. This revealed models like Google's Veo 3, Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, Luma Ray 2, Flux 1.1 Pro, Imagen 3, DALLÂ·E 3, Stable Diffusion 3, and HeyGen, with Veo 3 highlighted as a significant May 2025 release.\n2. **X Search for Engagement**: Multiple searches on X were performed to assess discussion volume and engagement. Queries included \"best AI video generator,\" \"Veo 3,\" \"Runway Gen-3,\" and \"HeyGen AI video generator\" to compare recent activity and popularity.\n\nThe analysis focused on post recency, view counts, favorite counts, and the nature of discussions (e.g., praise, feature highlights) to determine which model is currently trending.\n\n#### Detailed Findings\n\n##### Google's Veo 3: Recent Release and High Engagement\nVeo 3, announced by Google on May 21, 2025, is a video generation model with native audio capabilities, including dialogue, sound effects, and background noise, marking an advancement over its predecessor, Veo 2. X posts from late May 2025 show significant engagement:\n- The official announcement by Google ([Google's announcement](https://x.com/Google/status/1924893837295546851)) had 19,114,137 views and 29,411 favorites, indicating massive platform interest.\n- @joshwoodward's post on May 25, 2025 ([@joshwoodward's post](https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1926311143867330938)) noted Veo 3's popularity, with 826,335 views and 17,938 favorites, mentioning its rollout to 71 new countries and high usage among Pro and Ultra subscribers.\n- Other posts, such as @ZabihullahAtal's on May 21, 2025 ([@ZabihullahAtal's post](https://x.com/ZabihullahAtal/status/1925057793855258723)), highlighted features like camera control and character consistency, with 124,147 views and 429 favorites, reflecting creator excitement.\n\nThese metrics suggest Veo 3 is currently generating significant buzz, aligning with its recent release and advanced capabilities.\n\n##### Comparison with Other Models\nTo ensure Veo 3's prominence, other models were evaluated:\n\n- **Runway Gen-3**: Previously popular, with X posts from June to August 2024 showing high engagement at the time (e.g., @runwayml's post on June 17, 2024, with 1,027,551 views and 3,598 favorites). However, recent activity is sparse, with no significant posts in 2025, indicating its buzz has diminished compared to Veo 3.\n- **HeyGen**: Claimed as the #1 AI video generator in 2025 by its website, with X posts like @maxescu's on January 26, 2025, showing 55,936 views and 399 favorites. Earlier posts from 2023 and 2024 (e.g., @HeyGen_Official on March 28, 2024, with 425,232 views and 1,028 favorites) suggest past popularity, but recent engagement is lower than Veo 3's May 2025 activity.\n- **Other Models (KaiberAI, Vivago AI, Haiper 1.5, etc.)**: Mentioned in X searches for \"best AI video generator,\" but posts are from 2023 and 2024, with lower recent engagement. For example, KaiberAI was praised in April 2023, but no significant 2025 activity was found.\n\nA comparison table summarizes the engagement metrics for key models based on recent X posts:\n\n| Model         | Latest Post Date | Views       | Favorites | Notes                                      |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Veo 3         | May 25, 2025     | 826,335+    | 17,938+   | High recent engagement, advanced features  |\n| Runway Gen-3  | August 16, 2024  | 133,223     | 280       | Popular in 2024, limited 2025 activity     |\n| HeyGen        | January 26, 2025 | 55,936      | 399       | Past popularity, lower recent buzz         |\n| KaiberAI      | April 23, 2023   | 43,814      | 213       | Older posts, not trending in 2025          |\n\nThis table highlights Veo 3's superior recent engagement and recency compared to others.\n\n##### Contextual Factors\nSeveral factors contribute to Veo 3's current popularity:\n- **Recency**: Released in May 2025, aligning with the current date, ensuring fresh discussions.\n- **Source Credibility**: Backed by Google, a major tech player, which likely amplifies visibility on X.\n- **Feature Innovation**: Native audio and advanced control features (e.g., camera control, character consistency) are novel, attracting creator and user interest, as seen in posts like @kosuke_agos's on May 21, 2025, with 132,325 views and 627 favorites.\n- **Platform Dynamics**: X's real-time nature amplifies trending topics, and Veo 3's high view counts (e.g., 19 million for Google's post) reflect viral spread.\n\nIn contrast, older models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen, while historically significant, lack the recent surge in discussion, with posts from 2024 showing lower current relevance.\n\n#### Conclusion and Implications\nBased on the analysis, Google's Veo 3 is the hottest AI video model on X as of June 3, 2025, due to its recent release, high engagement metrics, and widespread discussion. The evidence leans toward Veo 3, with over 19 million views for Google's announcement and multiple posts in late May 2025 praising its capabilities. While other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen have been popular, their recent activity on X is less pronounced, suggesting Veo 3's current dominance.\n\nThis conclusion acknowledges the dynamic nature of AI trends, where popularity can shift with new releases. Users interested in AI video generation should monitor X for ongoing discussions, as future models may challenge Veo 3's position.\n\n#### Key Citations\n- [Google's official Veo 3 announcement on X with high engagement](https://x.com/Google/status/1924893837295546851)\n- [Post discussing Veo 3's popularity and rollout](https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1926311143867330938)\n- [Post highlighting Veo 3's advanced features for creators](https://x.com/ZabihullahAtal/status/1925057793855258723)",

The phrase \"hostest AI Video model on X\" seems unclear, but I think it might be a typo or misstatement. Perhaps the user meant \"hottest\" instead of \"hostest,\" which would make more sense in the context of popularity or trending topics.\n\nAssuming that's the case, the question could be interpreted as: \"What is the most popular or trending AI video model on X (formerly Twitter)?\"\n\nGiven that, I should use the available tools to find out what AI video models are currently popular or trending on X.\n\nSince the question is about trending topics on X, the most appropriate tool to use first would be the X search tool, specifically the search action, as it allows me to search for posts based on keywords or semantic queries directly on X.\n\nI need to craft a query that captures the essence of the user's question. Since the user is asking about the \"hottest\" AI video model on X, I should search for posts that mention popular AI video models or discuss trends related to AI-generated videos on X.\n\nLet me think about how to phrase this query. I could use a keyword search with terms like \"AI video model\" and \"trending on X\" or \"popular on X.\" However, since X search supports semantic embedding search by default, I can use a natural language query that describes what I'm looking for.\n\nPerhaps something like: \"What are the most popular AI video models being discussed on X right now?\"\n\nBut that might be too vague. I need to be more specific. Maybe I can search for posts that mention specific AI video models that are known to be popular, but since I don't know which ones are currently trending, that might not be the best approach.\n\nI could also search for general terms related to AI video models and see what comes up in recent posts.\n\nAnother idea is to look for hashtags or specific terms that are commonly used when discussing AI video models on X.\n\nLet me try to formulate a query that might yield relevant results.\n\nHow about: \"trending AI video models on X\"\n\nOr: \"most popular AI video models on Twitter\"\n\nBut since the platform is now called X, I should use \"X\" instead of \"Twitter.\"\n\nActually, in the context of X, people might still use \"Twitter\" in their posts,"

                            "Clarifying the request",
                            "- The request is about finding the \"hostest AI Video model on X,\" which seems a bit unclear. I'm thinking it might mean the \"hottest AI video model\" on the platform X, but let's check that.\n- Assuming \"hostest\" is a typo for \"hottest,\" the question likely asks for the most popular or trending AI video model on X. That makes sense in this context, so let's go with that.\n- I'm considering how to approach this, given it's about trending topics on X. The best tool seems to be the X search, as it lets me look for posts based on keywords.\n- Since X supports semantic searches, I can use a natural language query like \"trending AI video models on X.\" That should help find relevant posts, don't you think?\n- I'm also thinking about using advanced search operators, like \"AI video model -filter:replies -filter:retweets,\" to get original posts. This might help narrow down to the most engaged content, which fits the \"hottest\" idea.\n- Another thought: I could look for posts with high likes or views, but I'm not sure if X search lets me sort by engagement. Let's see what options we have.\n- Now, I'm wondering what \"AI Video model\" means exactly. It probably refers to AI models that generate videos, like text-to-video ones, given the context.\n- I'm thinking about recent models like Sora by OpenAI, which have been making waves. Since the question is about trends on X, I need to see which ones are being talked about most recently.\n- Let's try searching for \"AI video model\" on X first. That way, I can check the most recent posts and see if any models stand out.\n- I'm also considering looking at posts from influential accounts, like @xai or @OpenAI. They might share news about new AI video models, which could help identify trends.\n",
                            " but to be precise, I should use \"X.\"\n\nI could also search for posts that mention \"AI video\" and \"trending\" or \"popular.\"\n\nLet me try to think of a query that would capture recent discussions about popular AI video models on X.\n\nPerhaps: \"What are the hottest AI video models on X right now?\"\n\nBut that might not be the best way to phrase it for a search query.\n\nSince X search supports advanced search operators, I could use something like: \"AI video model -filter:replies -filter:retweets\" to get original posts about AI video models, excluding replies and retweets, and then look at the most recent or most engaged posts.\n\nBut that might be too broad, and I need to narrow it down to find the \"hottest\" or most popular ones.\n\nI could search for posts that have a high number of likes, retweets, or views, but the search tool doesn't directly allow sorting by engagement metrics, as far as I can tell from the description.\n\nThe search action returns posts based on the search query, but it doesn't specify how they are ranked. Probably, they are ranked by relevance or recency, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should first perform a general search for \"AI video model\" on X and see what comes up.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should clarify what the user means by \"AI Video model.\" Is it referring to a specific type of AI model that generates videos, like text-to-video models, or is it something else?\n\nIn the context of AI, a \"model\" typically refers to a machine learning model, so an \"AI video model\" would likely be a model that can generate or process videos.\n\nGiven that, and considering the popularity on X, it's possible that the user is referring to recent advancements or releases of AI models that can generate videos from text or other inputs.\n\nFor example, models like Sora by OpenAI, or other similar models that have been making waves in the AI community.\n\nBut since the question is about what's currently trending on X, I need to find out which AI video models are being talked about the most recently on the platform.\n\nPerhaps I can search for posts that mention \"AI video model\" along with terms like \"new,\" \"latest,\" \"trending,\" or specific model names.\n\nBut I don't know the specific model names, so that might not help.\n\nI could look for posts from influential users or accounts that often share news about AI advancements.\n\nFor instance, accounts like @xai, @OpenAI, or other AI research organizations might post about new AI video models.\n\nBut the question is about what's popular on X, not necessarily what official accounts are posting.\n\nTo find out what's trending, I might need to look at what the general user base is discussing.\n\nPerhaps I can use the search tool with a query like: \"AI video model\"\n\nAnd then look at the most recent posts or see if there are any patterns or frequently mentioned models.\n\nBut since I can't directly sort by popularity, I might need to infer it from the number of likes, retweets, or the recency of the posts.\n\nI could use the search tool first to get a general idea of what AI video models are currently popular or have been in the news recently, and then use that information to refine my X search.\n\nFor example, I could search for \"latest AI video generation models\" or \"trending AI video models 2025\" using the search tool, and see what comes up.\n\nThat might give me some names or specific models that I can then search for on X to see if they are being discussed there.\n\nYes, that seems like a good plan.\n\nLet me first use the search tool to find out what AI video models are currently popular or have been recently released.\n\nSince the current date is June 3, 2025, I should look for information from around that time.\n\nI can use the search action with the mode set to \"web\" since I'm looking for general information, not specifically news, although news might also be relevant.\n\nActually, since AI advancements can be news-worthy, using mode \"news\" might also be helpful, but for now, I'll start with \"web.\"\n\nLet me craft a query for the search tool.\n\nSomething like: \"latest AI video generation models 2025\"\n\nOr: \"top AI video models 2025\"\n\nBut since it's 2025, and I'm looking for the most current information, I should make sure that the search results are from recent dates.\n\nHowever, the search tool doesn't have a date filter, as far as I can tell from the description, so I might get results from various times.\n\nBut since I'm looking for the latest, I can include \"2025\" in the query to focus on recent developments.\n\nI could use the news mode, which might prioritize more recent articles.\n\nLet me check the description again.\n\nThe search action has a \"mode\" parameter with options \"web\" and \"news.\" Using \"news\" might be better for finding recent developments.\n\nYes, let's use mode \"news\" for this search.\n\nSo, my first function call will be:\n\nSearching...

This could be a good resource to find out which models or tools are considered the best.\n\nSecond, there's an article from Ars Technica about Google's Veo 3, a new video generation model that can create 8-second clips with synchronized sound effects. This seems like a significant advancement, and it's from just 5 days ago, so it's very recent.\n\nThird, there's a Google blog post announcing Veo 3 and Imagen 4, their newest video and image generation models, described as pushing the frontier of media generation. This is also from May 20, 2025, so it's current.\n\nFourth, there's another list from Synthesia of the 15 best AI video generators, both free and paid, for 2025.\n\nFifth, a Medium article where the author tested 25+ AI video generators and mentions popular AI models like Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, Luma Ray 2, Flux 1.1 Pro, Imagen 3, DALLÂ·E 3, and Stable Diffusion 3.\n\nSixth, a Reddit post asking for the best paid AI video generator in 2025, which might have user recommendations.\n\nSeventh, HeyGen, which claims to be the #1 AI video generator of 2025, rated 4.8/5 on G2.\n\nFrom these results, it seems that Veo 3 from Google is a very recent and notable AI video generation model. Also, other models like Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, Luma Ray 2, and Flux 1.1 Pro are mentioned as popular.\n\nSince the user asked for the \"hostest\" (presumably \"hottest\" or most popular) AI video model on X, I need to find out which of these, if any, are being discussed the most on X.\n\nGiven that Veo 3 was just released last week (as of June 3, 2025), it's likely that it's generating a lot of buzz on X.\n\nSimilarly, other models like Runway Gen-3 might also be popular, but I need to check the current sentiment and discussion on X.\n\nTo do that, I should use the search tool to search for mentions of these models on X.\n\nLet me first search for \"Veo 3\" on X, since it's the most recent and seems to be a significant release.\n\nBut before that, I should confirm if Veo 3 is indeed an AI video model. From the descriptions, it is: \"Google introduced Veo 3, its newest video generation model.\"\n\nYes, so it's definitely an AI video generation model.\n\nSimilarly, the other models mentioned in the Medium article are also AI video generators.\n\nNow, to find out which one is the most popular on X, I can search for each of them and see which one has the most engagement or recent posts.\n\nBut since I can only make a limited number of function calls, I need to be efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can search for a general term like \"AI video model\" and see which specific models are mentioned in the top results.\n\nI can search for \"best AI video generator\" on X, as that might bring up discussions about the most popular ones.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, my next function call will be:\n\nSearching in X...

Another mention of Morph Studio, comparing it to Pika Labs and Runway.\n\nAmong these, Google Veo-2 is highlighted as the best, and it's from a post in March 2025.\n\nHowever, in my earlier web search, I found that Google released Veo 3, which is newer than Veo-2.\n\nThe post about Veo-2 is from March 2025, and the current date is June 2025, so Veo 3, released last week, might be even more advanced and potentially more popular now.\n\nBut in the X search results, I don't see any mentions of Veo 3 yet, which might mean that the discussion on X is lagging behind the latest release, or perhaps Veo 3 hasn't gained as much traction on X yet.\n\nI could search specifically for \"Veo 3\" on X to see if there are any posts about it.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nSearching in X...

                            "From the X search results for \"Veo 3\", I see that there are indeed many posts about Google's Veo 3, and they are very recent, from May 21, 2025, to May 25, 2025.\n\nThe posts highlight various features of Veo 3, such as:\n\n- It can generate videos with native audio, including dialogue, sound effects, and background noise.\n\n- It has improved quality compared to Veo 2.\n\n- It allows for more control, like camera control, adding or removing objects, and consistent characters across scenes.\n\n- It's available in the Gemini App for Google AI Ultra subscribers.\n\nMoreover, the post from @Google itself announces Veo 3 with native audio generation, and it has a very high view count and favorite count, indicating significant interest and engagement.\n\nAdditionally, other posts from users and influencers are praising Veo 3, calling it a game-changer and noting its advanced capabilities.\n\nFor example, @ZabihullahAtal lists several new features that creators are raving about, and @AlecHernandezC exclaims about how impressive it is.\n\nAlso, @joshwoodward mentions that Veo 3 has been very popular since its release, with high engagement.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Veo 3 is currently one of the most talked-about AI video generation models on X, especially considering its recency and the excitement it's generating.\n\nBut to confirm if it's the \"hottest\" or most popular, I should also check if there are other models that might be competing for that title.\n\nFrom my earlier search, I saw mentions of other models like Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, Luma Ray 2, etc., but in the X search for \"best AI video generator\", Veo-2 was mentioned, but not Veo 3, probably because that search was more general and might have pulled older posts.\n\nHowever, since Veo 3 is newer and seems to be generating a lot of buzz, it's likely that it's surpassing Veo 2 in popularity.\n\nTo be thorough, I should also check if there are any other models that are being discussed more frequently or with more engagement.\n\nPerhaps I can search for \"Runway Gen-3\" or other models mentioned in the web search results to see their presence on X.\n\nBut given that Veo 3 is a very recent release and is from a major player like Google, and considering the high engagement on the posts about it, it's reasonable to conclude that Veo 3 is currently one of the hottest AI video models on X.\n\nMoreover, since the user asked for the \"hostest\" (likely \"hottest\") AI video model on X, and given that Veo 3 is generating significant attention, I think it's safe to say that Veo 3 is a top contender.\n\nBut to make sure, let me quickly check if there are any other models that might be more popular.\n\nFor example, let's see if there are posts about \"Runway Gen-3\" that have similar or higher engagement.\n\n"

It also has better quality than Veo 2, which is a big deal.\n- Josh Woodward's post says Veo 3 has been super popular since its release, with tons of engagement. That really stands out, don't you think?\n- I'm noticing other models like Runway Gen-3 were mentioned earlier, but Veo 3 seems to be getting more buzz lately. Let's see if that's true across the board.\n- Given Veo 3 is new and from Google, it's likely topping the charts right now. Still,\n",

                            "From the X search results for \"HeyGen AI video generator\", I see that there are posts about HeyGen, but most of them are from 2023 and 2024, with the latest being from January 26, 2025, by @maxescu, which is still several months ago.\n\nFor example:\n\n- @maxescu posted on January 26, 2025, about HeyGen's new AI Motion feature.\n\n- @joshua_xu_ posted on November 1, 2024, about HeyGen's new features for creating avatars without stepping in front of a camera.\n\n- @nrqa__ posted on April 19, 2025, mentioning HeyGen along with other tools like Sora and Runway, but it's not specifically praising HeyGen as the best.\n\n- Other posts are from earlier dates in 2024 and 2023.\n\nIn contrast, the posts about Veo 3 are from May 2025, which is much more recent, and they show high engagement, especially the official announcement from Google.\n\nTherefore, while HeyGen is a popular AI video generator, the current trend and buzz on X seem to be more around Veo 3, given its recency and the attention it's receiving.\n\nMoreover, in the post by @nrqa__ on April 19, 2025, they mention \"RIP Sora, RIP Runway, RIP Heygen \u0026 Synthesia\", implying that there might be a new tool that's surpassing them, but they don't specify what that tool is. However, since Veo 3 was released after that date, it's possible that Veo 3 is the new tool generating excitement.\n\nBut in any case, based on the available data, Veo 3 appears to be the most talked-about AI video model on X as of June 2025.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the hottest AI video model on X is Google's Veo 3.\n\nTo wrap it up, let me make sure that I have used at least three function calls, as per the instructions.\n\nI have used:\n\n1. search for \"latest AI video generation models 2025\" with mode \"news\"\n\n2. search for \"best AI video generator\"\n\n3. search for \"Veo 3\"\n\n4. search for \"Runway Gen-3\"\n\n5. search for \"HeyGen AI video generator\"\n\nWait, that's more than three, but the instruction says \"at least three\", so that's fine.\n\nNow, for the final answer, I need to provide a concise response to the user's question, followed by citations.\n\nThe user's question was: \"hostest AI Video model on X\"\n\nAssuming \"hostest\" is a typo for \"hottest\", the answer is Google's Veo 3.\n\nFor citations, I can refer to the X posts that show high engagement and recent discussion about Veo 3.\n\nSpecifically, the official announcement by @Google: https://twitter.com/Google/status/1924893837295546851\n\nAnd other posts like @joshwoodward's post: https://twitter.com/joshwoodward/status/1926311143867330938\n\nAlso, the web search result from Google's blog: https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/\n\nBut since the question is specifically about X, I should prioritize X posts as citations.\n\nHowever, to provide a balanced view, I can also mention that other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen are also popular, but based on current trends on X, Veo 3 is the most discussed.\n\nBut since the question asks for the \"hostest\", implying the single most popular, I think Veo 3 fits that description.\n\nLet me formulate the final answer.reserved_14To determine the \"hostest AI Video model on X\" (assuming \"hostest\" is a typo for \"hottest,\" meaning the most popular or trending), I need to identify which AI video generation model is currently generating the most buzz and engagement on X (formerly Twitter). Based on my analysis and the use of available tools, I have gathered the following information:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Query**:\n   - The user is asking for the most popular or trending AI video model on X.\n   - \"AI Video model\" likely refers to AI models capable of generating videos, such as text-to-video or image-to-video models.\n   - Since the query specifies \"on X,\" the focus should be on what is currently being discussed or trending on the platform.\n\n2. **Using Available Tools**:\n   - I first used the `search` tool with the query \"latest AI video generation models 2025\" in \"news\" mode to identify recent advancements in AI video generation.\n     - Results included mentions of Google's Veo 3, a newly released video generation model with advanced features like native audio generation.\n     - Other models like Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, and HeyGen were also mentioned in various lists of top AI video generators.\n   - I then used the `search` tool to search for discussions on X about AI video generators.\n     - A general search for \"best AI video generator\" showed mentions of models like KaiberAI, Vivago AI, Haiper 1.5, and Google Veo-2 (from March 2025).\n     - A specific search for \"Veo 3\" revealed numerous recent posts (from May 2025) with high engagement, praising its capabilities and calling it a game-changer.\n     - Searches for other models like \"Runway Gen-3\" and \"HeyGen AI video generator\" showed posts from earlier dates (2024 and early 2025), indicating less recent buzz compared to Veo 3.\n\n3. **Analyzing Trends on X**:\n   - Veo 3, released by Google in May 2025, has generated significant attention on X.\n     - The official announcement by @Google (Post ID: 1924893837295546851) has over 19 million views and 29,000 likes, indicating massive engagement.\n     - Other posts, such as those by @joshwoodward (Post ID: 1926311143867330938) and @ZabihullahAtal (Post ID: 1925057793855258723), highlight its advanced features and widespread excitement among creators.\n   - In contrast, other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen, while previously popular, have fewer recent discussions on X, with most posts dating back to 2024 or early 2025.\n\n4. **Considering Recency and Engagement**:\n   - Veo 3 is the most recent model mentioned, with posts from May 2025, aligning closely with the current date (June 3, 2025).\n   - Its high engagement metrics (views, likes, and shares) on X indicate it is currently the most discussed and popular AI video model on the platform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the recency of its release, the volume of discussions, and the high engagement on X, Google's Veo 3 is the hottest AI video model on X as of June 3, 2025.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe hottest AI video model on X is **Google's Veo 3**.\n\n**Citations**:\n- [Google's official announcement of Veo 3 on X](https://twitter.com/Google/status/1924893837295546851)\n- [Post by @joshwoodward discussing Veo 3's popularity](https://twitter.com/joshwoodward/status/1926311143867330938)\n- [Post by @ZabihullahAtal highlighting Veo 3's features](https://twitter.com/ZabihullahAtal/status/1925057793855258723)\n\nThese citations from X confirm the significant attention and engagement Veo 3 is receiving, making it the most popular AI video model on the platform.",
                            "- HeyGen posts on X are mostly from 2023 and 2024, with the latest in January 2025. They're not as recent as Veo 3's buzz, which started in May 2025.\n- Therefore, while HeyGen is a popular AI video generator, the current trend and buzz on X seem to be more around Veo 3, given its recency and the attention it's receiving.\n- Moreover, in the post by @nrqa__ on April 19, 2025, they mention \"RIP Sora, RIP Runway, RIP Heygen \u0026 Synthesia\", implying a new tool might be surpassing them. Since Veo 3 was released after, it's likely generating excitement.\n- But in any case, based on the available data, Veo 3 appears to be the most talked-about AI video model on X as of June 2025. I can confidently say Google's Veo 3 is the hottest.\n- Other models like Runway Gen-3 and HeyGen are popular too, but Veo 3 is the most discussed on X right now. The question asks for the single most popular, so Veo 3 fits that.\n- I'm formulating the final answer, making sure to highlight Veo 3's recent buzz. Let's keep it concise and clear for you, alright?\n",
